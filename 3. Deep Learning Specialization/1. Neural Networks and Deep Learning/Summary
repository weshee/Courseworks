Taught by Andrew Ng from deeplearning.ai (Offered through Coursera)
Programming software: Python

Module 1: Introduction to deep learning
  - Review on supervised learning with neural networks
 
Module 2: Neural networks basics
  - Logistic regression as a neural network
  - Python and vectorization (with numpy)
  - Preprocessing a new dataset
    * Figure out the dimensions and shapes of the problem (m_train, m_test, num_px, ...)
    * Reshape the datasets such that each example is now a vector of size (num_px * num_px * 3, 1)
    * "Standardize" the data
  - Programming assignment: Logistic regression with a neural network mindset (image recognition algorithm)

Module 3: Shallow neural networks
  - Nonlinear activation functions
  - Gradient descent for neural networks
  - Programming assignment: Planar data classification with a hidden layer
  
Module 4: Deep neural networks
  - Forward and back propagation in a deep network
  - Building blocks of deep neural networks
  - Parameters vs hyperparameters
  - The general methodology to build a NN is to:
    1. Define the model structure (n_x, n_h, n_y, etc)
    2. Initialize the model's parameters for an L-layer neural network
    3. Implement the forward propagation module
       * Complete the LINEAR part of a layer's forward propagation step
       * Compute [LINEAR -> ACTIVATION] forward function
       * Compute L_model_forward function
    4. Compute the loss
    5. Implement the backward propagation module
       * Complete the LINEAR part of a layer's backward propagation step
       * Compute [LINEAR -> ACTIVATION] backward function
       * Compute L_model_backward function
    6. Update the parameters
    7. Repeat steps 1-5
  - Programming assignment: Deep neural network application with L-layer neural network.
