Taught by Andrew Ng from deeplearning.ai (Offered through Coursera)
Programming software: Python

Module 1: Foundations of convolutional neural networks
  - Edge detection

Module 2: Deep convolutional models: case studies
  - LeNet-5, AlexNet, VGG-16
  - ResNets
  - 1x1 convolutions
  - Assignment: ResNets
    * Very deep "plain" networks don't work in practice because they are hard to train due to vanishing gradients.
    * The skip-connections help to address the Vanishing Gradient problem. They also make it easy for a ResNet block to learn an identity function.
    * There are two main types of blocks: The identity block and the convolutional block.
    * Very deep Residual Networks are built by stacking these blocks together.

Module 3: Object detection
  - Detection algorithm
    * Object localisation
    * Landmark detection
    * Object detection
    * Convolutional implementation of sliding windows
    * Bounding box predictions
    * Intersection over union
    * Nonmax suppression
    * Anchor boxes
    * YOLO algorithm
  - Assignment: Autonomous driving application car detection
